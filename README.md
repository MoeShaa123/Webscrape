# Webscrape

Made a Python script which extracts information from a website using the module BeautifulSoup

The website I chose to data scrape from is leaderboard from one of the most popular games out there

The data is then saved and formatted into an Excel file

By integrating this script into Jenkins, I can run a job which automatically updates the Excel file every minute
